    <ol>
        <li>Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and coriander in a blender; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; pour in blended marinade and seal. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Whisk yogurt, sriracha sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper together to make the sauce. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Cook skin-side down until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Let chicken for 5 to 10 minutes, then chop into chunks.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add turmeric and cumin; cook and stir until fragrant. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until toasted, about 4 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and cook until broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove Dutch oven from the heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide rice and chicken among serving bowls. Drizzle yogurt sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
